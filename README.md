# Professional-Portfolio
## Introduction
I was assigned to create a personal professional portfolio that showcases my current skills
as a developer and as I progress in my coding bootcamp at The Ohio State University I will
add more applications to the deployment and approve on my previous submissions. The idea
behind this project is to have me to be employer competitive with a portfolio the shows 
what I am capable of.
